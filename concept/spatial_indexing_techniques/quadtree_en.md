## ‚úÖ **QuadTrees**

### üìò Overview
![QuadTree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyungtaek-jonas-lim/jonastudy/main/concept/spatial_indexing_techniques/quadtree.png)
- A QuadTree is a **hierarchical tree structure** that recursively divides a 2D space into four quadrants.
- The depth of the tree depends on **data density**‚Äîregions with more data are subdivided more finely. This makes QuadTrees a **density-dependent partitioning** method.
- In tools like **PostGIS**, spatial indexing mechanisms such as `GiST` often use data structures similar to QuadTrees (or R-Trees) to efficiently manage and query spatial data.

### üëç Pros
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Efficient hierarchical indexing | The hierarchical structure allows fast indexing and querying of spatial data. |
| Ideal for bounding box and spatial queries | The quadrant-based division makes QuadTrees suitable for various types of **range queries**, especially bounding box searches. |
| Consistent precision across space | Offers uniform precision regardless of the region, providing reliable spatial resolution. |

### üëé Cons
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| More complex to implement | QuadTrees are more complex than GeoHashing and may involve higher computational overhead. |
| Higher storage requirements | The tree structure and use of pointers result in larger storage footprints. |
| Not ideal for sharing location | Unlike GeoHashing, QuadTrees don't offer a simple string format, making it harder to share location data between systems or over networks.

## ‚úÖ Comparison Summary: QuadTree vs. [GeoHashing](https://github.com/kyungtaek-jonas-lim/jonastudy/blob/main/concept/spatial_indexing_techniques/geohashing_en.md)

| Feature | **QuadTree** | **GeoHashing** |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Structure | Hierarchical tree | Grid with Base32 string encoding |
| Density awareness | Yes (density-dependent) | No (uniform grid splitting) |
| Precision control | Dynamically adjustable | Fixed by string length |
| Spatial search efficiency | High, especially for bounding boxes | Good for proximity; limited for bounding boxes |
| Implementation complexity | Relatively high | Relatively simple |
| Storage requirements | High (tree structure, pointers) | Low (string only) |
| PostgreSQL usage | Well-supported via PostGIS GiST index | Supported via `ST_GeoHash()`, but rarely used for querying |
| Redis usage | Requires manual structure | Fully supported via RedisGeo module |
